# Offshore Crane Sim

## Aim

This project aims to aid and accelerate the development of remote crane functionality by creating:
1. A rigid body dynamics simulation of the crane and wire.
2. A model where the wire is represented as a chain of rigid bodies.

## Task Description

This project focuses on:

- **Moving Frame Analysis**:
  - Crane dynamics.
  - Wire dynamics.

- **Algorithm Development**:
  - Generalized algorithm for an arbitrary number of rigid bodies.

- **Tools and Technologies**:
  - Software: JavaScript, WebGL, C++, Python
  - 3D modeling: CAD systems such as Creo or Inventor.

## Project Deliverables

- A functional simulation of the crane and wire using rigid body dynamics.
- Documentation and visualizations to support collaboration with other teams.
