Model the wire and crane as a pendulum, use acceleration and velocity to compute the energy and trajectory.
Depending on the load, we might be able to use multiple rigid bodies. 

Use axis of seperation theorem to check if there is a collision over the trajectory. 
Need to check how many points over the trajectory we need to check, this depends on the compotational load. 
    - The theorem is not able to return the coordinate, but only if the objects are intersecting

The simulation ends here in my opinion, as the accuracy after a collision is not possible to guarantee. 

For illustrative purpoces we can get the coordinates and rotate the load / crate a bit. 
If a collision is detected, use Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi distance algorithm to approximate the point of contact, 
return this as a load in the MFM code to spin the crate.
